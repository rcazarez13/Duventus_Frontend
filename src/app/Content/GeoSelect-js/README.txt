This code is a JavaScript code that initializes a geo-select form. It uses the jQuery library and the SweetAlert library to display messages and the PapaParse library to parse a CSV file.

The code defines three variables to hold lists of cities, states, and countries. It also defines an object called "settings" that contains messages and placeholders to be used in the form.

The code then waits for the document to be ready using the jQuery shorthand function $(function() {...}). It checks the current locale and sets the settings object accordingly. It then displays a loading message using the SweetAlert library.

The code uses the jQuery $.getJSON() function to load a JSON file containing the list of states and populates the states_list variable. It then enables the state select element, adds a placeholder option, and disables the city select element.

The code uses the $.when().then() method to load a CSV file containing the list of cities and parse it using the PapaParse library. Once the cities are loaded, it populates the cities_list variable, enables the city select element, adds a placeholder option, closes the loading message, and calls the InitGeoSelect() function.

The code uses the jQuery $.getJSON() function to load a JSON file containing the list of countries and populates the countries_list variable. It then generates a list of options for the country select element and adds a placeholder option.

The code disables all select elements and adds a loading message to them. It also adds the "invalid" class to select elements that are marked as required.

The code then sets up event handlers for the state, country, and city select elements. When the state is changed, it filters the list of cities based on the selected state and populates the city select element with the filtered list. It also sets the value of the state input element and adds or removes the "invalid" class based on whether the state is required and selected.

When the country is changed, it filters the list of states based on the selected country and populates the state select element with the filtered list. It also sets the value of the country input element and adds or removes the "invalid" class based on whether the country is required and selected.

When the city is changed, it sets the value of the city input element and adds or removes the "invalid" class based on whether the city is required and selected.

The InitGeoSelect() function is called when the cities are loaded. It sets up event handlers for the country select element and sets the selected country based on the value of the country input element. It also sets up event handlers for the state and city select elements and sets the selected state and city based on the values of the state and city input elements. It then triggers the change event on the country, state, and city select elements to update the form based on the initial values.
